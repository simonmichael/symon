# symon

Minimal implementation(s) of the classic electronic memory game.

This was an attempt to submit a ludum dare entry in 2h.
It is also a nice kata (exercise) for practising haskell game development.
And could be used to demonstrate different libraries and approaches.

Currently there is one implementation: command line, no sound, using only standard libs.
There are some time log notes in the source.

Improvements, new implementations and project collaborators are welcome.

# symon

Minimal implementation(s) of the classic electronic memory game.
This was an attempt to submit a ludum dare entry in 2h,
and is also a nice kata (exercise) for haskell game development.

Currently there is one implementation: command line, no sound, using only standard libs.
There are some time log notes in the source.

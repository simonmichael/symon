# symon

Minimal implementation(s) of the classic memory game.

This was an attempt to submit a ludum dare entry in 2h.
It is also a nice kata (exercise) for practising haskell game development
and/or demonstrating different libraries and approaches.
Improvements, new implementations and co-developers are welcome.

Currently there is one implementation, a minimal ansi command line one.

$ symon-ansi

A sequence of digits is displayed repeatedly, growing each time;
enter the same digits before time's up to keep playing.
Can you beat it ?
